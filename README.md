My little BASH tweaks that help me type less

Note:
If you want to be able to alias these files, gotta make them executable first:
chmod +x yourscript.sh


Todo:
For lanc.sh - Have the PWD, git branch, and git log commands output to a file, then display only the key elements I need from that file to the console:

- Working Directoy
- Current Git Branch
- Current Git Commit

Instead of having them all output as separate commands. 

Ideally, I'd like to output the above in this format:
(current working directory) (current branch) - (current commit SHA 7 digits)

Shouldn't be too difficult right?
